### Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub page!

**I am continually updating my repositories to make my <a href="https://rycu.notion.site/Ryan-Cubero-8e7a199828264d79bae252cbf6b45582?pvs=4">research works</a> as accessible as possible.**

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on extracting topological signatures of microglia morphology to unravel its region- and sex-specific spectrum of phenotypes across brain and retinal development, and neurodegeneration.

- ðŸŒ± I am interested in conversations about finding ways to maximize productivity and streamlining workflows.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about open science! I am involved with <a href="https://asapbio.org/">ASAPBio</a> in advocating for pre-prints and crowd reviewing in the biological sciences!

- âš¡ Outside my <a href="https://ist.ac.at/en/research/siegert-group/">current lab</a> and the coding sphere, I enjoy running/hiking trails, video games, flat whites, big and fluffy dogs, Oxford commas, and the color blue.
